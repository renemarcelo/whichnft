# Project Goal

Part of a 2-person UX team for an NFT product at the start of its development, I looked at what other established applications were doing well in this sphere.  This is my favorite way to begin when starting from scratch.

It was difficult to firstly find an app that pierced through the jargon for outsiders.  Even when looking at sections of popular apps aimed to walk you about the industry terms, all failed to thoroughly the elephant-in-the-room pain points in those  'lessons' and 'quizzesâ€™ that were poorly constructed. In most cases, purchasing user onboarding essentally amounts to a band-aid solution to a UX problem.

At the current app state, attempted walkthroughs of the primary interface occured together with payouts.  Paying for a potential user to complete the onboarding process is inefficient.

# Solution

Together with User-interview data, I transformed a sketch into a starter wireframe that addressed the 'risky undertaking' theme by emphasizing past user behavior to a particular asset, or collection of assets.

There is even reason to think that problem is a bit manufactured to serve to defer to the app for what the user does not understand.  In the spirit of following problems that are created as a product, I have included some GIFs of my working on Microsoft Powerapps Studio
