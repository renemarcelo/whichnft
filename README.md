# Project Goal

This project is part of a 2-person UX team for an NFT product at the start of its development.

I looked at what other established applications were doing well in this sphere.  This is my favorite way to begin.

When looking at sections of popular apps aimed to walk you about the industry terms, all failed thoroughly.


# Current app state

walkthroughs of the primary interface occured together with some type of payout device.  Paying for a new user to complete the onboarding process.

In most cases, purchasing user onboarding essentally amounts to a band-aid solution to a UX problem.


# Solution


## risky undertaking

With user-interview data, I transformed a sketch into a starter wireframe that addressed the  theme by emphasizing past user behavior to a particular asset, or collection of assets.

There is even reason to think that problem is a bit manufactured to serve to defer to the app for what the user does not understand.
