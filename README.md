# Project Goal

This project is part of a 2-person UX team for an NFT product at the start of its development.
I looked at what other established applications were doing well in this sphere. This is my favorite way to begin.
Looking at learning sections of popular nft apps, these are aimed to walk you about the industry terms.

# Current app state

Walkthroughs of the primary interface occured together with some type of payout. Paying for a new user to complete the onboarding process.

# Solution

## NFT undertaking
Collections seem to want to addressed past user behavior and link it to a particular asset, or collection of assets.
There is even reason to think that problem is a bit manufactured. Are theme of risk gave non-answers to the questions of "what is this for to a creator?"
